        <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, folks</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Welcome to my social media app! I built this project because I thought
          it was fun.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Much like a regular social media app, you are able to create posts,
          comments, like content, follow users, and have followers.
        </p>
        <br />
        {user?.credentials === "SPECTATOR" ? (
          <>
            <p>
              Like many popular social media platforms, this space is filled
              with bots. Here&apos;s the challenge:{" "}
              <b> Can you tell if the users below are real people?</b>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Press the ðŸ¤– button if you think they&apos;re AI, or the ðŸ§‘ button
              if they&apos;re human.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sure, it might be easy since my app is fairly simple â€” but what
              about on other more popular platforms?
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Anyway, give it a try and see for yourself. Have fun!</p>
          </>

            <p>
              As a regular user, your feed will only show you content that you
              made, and from users that you follow. Spectators will be able to
              view and rate your posts.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But here&apos;s the challenge:
              <b> Can you create content that feels convincingly human?</b>
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Let&apos;s see if your posts stand out from the AI-generated ones.
              Have fun!
            </p>
