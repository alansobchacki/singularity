## Backend

The backend is built using **Nest.js** and **PostgreSQL**, offering a modular, scalable structure with robust security and testing.

| Layer     | Technology       | Description                                  |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Framework | Nest.js          | Scalable Node.js framework for building APIs |
| Database  | PostgreSQL       | Relational database for complex data models  |
| ORM       | TypeORM          | Object-relational mapping                    |
| Auth      | JWT, Bcrypt      | Token-based auth with hashed passwords       |
| Security  | CORS, Throttling | API protection and request limiting          |
| AI        | Perspective API  | Detects toxicity in text                     |
| Docs      | Swagger, Postman | API documentation                            |
| Caching   | Redis            | In-memory data store for fast data caching   |
| Testing   | Jest             | Unit and integration testing                 |

I chose Nest.js over regular Node + Express due to:

- Clean, scalable code organization using modules, controllers, and services.  
- Out-of-the-box support for validation, dependency injection, guards, interceptors, and more.  
- Full TypeScript support with strong typing and IntelliSense, making development safer and more efficient.

### Database schema

PostgreSQL manages a normalized schema:

```ts
@Entity()
export class AuthenticationUsers {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid', { name: 'ID' })
  id: string;

  @Column({ name: 'EMAIL', unique: true })
  email: string;

  @Column({ name: 'PASSWORD' })
  password: string;

  @Column({ name: 'NAME' })
  name: string;

  @Column({ name: 'PROFILE_PICTURE', nullable: true })
  profilePicture?: string;

  @Column({ name: 'BIO', nullable: true })
  bio?: string;

  @Column({ name: 'LOCATION', nullable: true })
  location?: string;

  @OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.author)
  posts: Post[];

  @OneToMany(() => Comment, (comment) => comment.author)
  comments: Comment[];

  @OneToMany(() => Follow, (follow) => follow.follower)
  following: Follow[];

  @OneToMany(() => Follow, (follow) => follow.following)
  followers: Follow[];

  @Column({
    type: 'enum',
    enum: ['REGULAR', 'BOT', 'ADMIN', 'SPECTATOR'],
    default: 'REGULAR',
  })
  userType: 'REGULAR' | 'BOT' | 'ADMIN' | 'SPECTATOR';

  @Column({ type: 'enum', enum: ['ACTIVE', 'SUSPENDED'], default: 'ACTIVE' })
  accountStatus: 'ACTIVE' | 'SUSPENDED';

  @CreateDateColumn({ name: 'CREATED_AT' })
  createdAt: Date;

  @UpdateDateColumn({ name: 'UPDATED_AT' })
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

Each user can have:

- Posts
- Comments
- Two Follow relationships (following/followers)
- One Like per content type (post or comment)

### AI

To prevent malicious users from creating controversial accounts and contents, we use AI to detect and prevent such content from being created.

```ts
export default async function checkToxicity(content: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://commentanalyzer.googleapis.com/v1alpha1/comments:analyze?key=${process.env.PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY}`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        comment: { text: content },
        languages: ['en', 'pt'],
        requestedAttributes: { 
          TOXICITY: {}
        },
      }),
    }
  );

  if (!response.ok) {
    console.error('Error checking toxicity:', response.statusText);
    throw new Error('Toxicity check failed');
  }

  const data = await response.json();
  const toxicityScore = data.attributeScores.TOXICITY.summaryScore.value;

  return toxicityScore >= 0.6; 
}
```

When a user attempts to create an account, a post, or a comment, that string is parsed by an LLM, which outputs a score. If the content scores 0.6 or more, the content is toxic, and the user is prompted to re-write their input.

### Documentation

Swagger is used to document all available routes and payloads.

![odinbook-swagger](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c20429df-57d6-4993-9ac8-14438958826e)

When running locally, access it at: ```http://localhost:3800/api```

A Postman collection holding every endpoint is also available at ```backend/postman``` for ease of use.

### Caching

To improve performance and reduce database load, the backend uses Redis as an in-memory cache for frequently accessed queries. Cached data is stored with expiration times (TTL - Time To Live) to ensure data freshness.

![chrome_2LK358P8U3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac0f86db-579e-46c0-8a40-90b3679112d6)

Cache invalidation happens automatically through TTL expiration, and is also manually triggered on certain mutation routes (such as PUT and POST requests) that update the underlying data. This ensures users always receive up-to-date information without sacrificing speed.

### User Testing

The backend currently includes **46 unit and integration tests** covering controllers, services, middleware, and auth flows.

![odinbook-tests](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6f5ed00-576e-4375-8583-7cbbbe0f6acb)

To run tests:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

## Frontend

For the frontend, I used **Next.js** for building the application and **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

| Layer         | Technology        | Description                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Framework     | Next.js           | React framework with built-in SSR                      |
| Styling       | Tailwind CSS      | Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development             |
| State         | Jotai             | Minimal and flexible global state management           |
| Data Fetching | Axios, TanStack   | Axios for HTTP requests, TanStack Query for caching    |
| Forms         | Formik, Yup       | Form state handling and schema validation              |
| UI Components | Material UI (MUI) | Component library for consistent and accessible design |
| Testing       | Cypress           | End-to-end testing framework for reliable UI testing   |

I chose Next.js over React and other frontend frameworks due to:

- Built-in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) ensures better indexing by search engines (should I ever build a landing page for this).  
- Seamless deployment and performance tuning thanks to tight integration with Vercel.  
- Automatic resizing, lazy loading, and modern formats improve load times and UX.

### Global state management

I used **Jotai** to handle global state management due to its minimalistic and flexible approach.

```ts
export const useLogin = () => {
  const [, setAuthState] = useAtom(authStateAtom);
  const router = useRouter();

  return useMutation<AuthToken, Error, LoginRequest>({
    mutationFn: postLogin,
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      const decodedToken: DecodedToken = jwtDecode(data.access_token);
      const userId = decodedToken.sub;
      const userType = decodedToken.userType;

      localStorage.setItem("accessToken", data.access_token);
      setAuthState({ id: userId, credentials: userType, isAuthenticated: true });
      router.replace("/dashboard");
    },
  });
};
```

A global state is set after a successful login. The ```userId``` is often needed for other API queries, so saving it into a global state is needed to reduce API overload.

### Data Fetching

The frontend uses **React Query (TanStack Query)** to manage asynchronous data fetching, caching, and updating. It simplifies API calls by handling loading states, caching, and refetching out of the box.

Key benefits include:

- Automatic caching and background updates for fresh data.
- Declarative and consistent handling of loading, error, and success states.
- Built-in support for query invalidation, pagination, and optimistic updates.

This significantly reduces boilerplate compared to manual data fetching with `useEffect` and improves performance by preventing unnecessary network requests.

### Responsiveness

The app follows a desktop-first design methodology, but is also responsive on mobile devices:

![chrome_yM5SPvamEN](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/384bf5f3-1ae4-45b4-95e1-69c85cad2b50)

### End-to-End Testing

End-to-end (E2E) tests are written using **Cypress** to ensure that critical user flows behave as expected in the browser.

![msrdc_QThL6Emn9W](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f25381-e6b3-439f-b237-a103dd1dadb0)

These tests simulate real user interactions such as logging in, navigating pages, posting content, and interacting with other users. The goal is to catch regressions and verify that the app works from the user's perspective.

To run E2E tests locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress test runner. From there, you can run tests interactively.

## Installation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This guide assumes familiarity with git, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, and a Linux-based terminal.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/singularity-app.git
cd singularity-app
```

### 2. Install necessary packages

Install packages for both the backend and frontend:

```
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Create environment variables

Create .env files in both the /frontend and /backend directories.

For the frontend, create an .env file with these settings:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3800
NEXT_PUBLIC_AVATAR_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000/avatars
```

Now, for the backend, create an .env file with these settings:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires a running local PostgreSQL instance and a Perspective API key.

```
NODE_ENV='development'
PORT=3800

FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
AVATAR_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/avatars/

// fill the empty variables with values from your own postgres database
DB_TYPE=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_DATABASE=
DB_ENTITIES=dist/**/*.entity.js
DB_MIGRATIONS=dist/infrastructure/migrations/*.js
DB_SSL_ACTIVE=false

// these are the account details of the mock users in the database
// for the email fields, add random valid emails
// for the password fields, make sure they're at least 8 characters long
ADMIN_EMAIL="
SPECTATOR_EMAIL=
REGULAR_PASSWORD=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
SPECTATOR_PASSWORD=
 
// create your own JWT secret value
JWT_SECRET=

// you will also need your own perspective API key
PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY=
```

### 4. Initialize the database

Run the database migrations:

```
cd backend
npm run migration:run
```

This will build a basic database in your postgres, and the app is now functional. However, without any users, certain features will not work. Run this script:

```
npm run initializeDb
```

This will create 12 users in your database: an admin account, a spectator account, and 10 mock users.

### 5. Run the project

Initialize the front end by runnning:

```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

For the backend, you have two choices: run with Node:

```
cd backend
npm run start
```

Or use Docker:

```
cd backend
docker build -t singularity-api .
docker run -p 3800:3800 singularity-api
```

Use whichever method you feel more comfortable with. The API will be accessible through http://localhost:3800/, and the front-end through http://localhost:3000/

## Additional Notes

This is a hobby project I built and maintain in my spare time to explore different technologies and experiment with full-stack development.

The frontend is deployed on **Vercel**, the backend on **Railway**, and the database on **AWS RDS**, all running on free-tier plans. As a result, you may experience cold starts or occasional downtime when using the live demo.

---

### Upcoming Features

Here are some features I plan to implement in future updates (in no particular order):

- User profile editing: allowing users to update their bio, name, and profile picture.
- Media support: enabling image and GIF uploads on posts and comments.
- Bot activity: using cron jobs to simulate more frequent interactions from BOT accounts.
- Real-time chat: implementing WebSocket-based messaging for live conversations between connected users.

---

### Known Limitations

There are a few known areas that need improvement:

- **Authentication** is currently handled via `localStorage`. Switching to **HttpOnly cookies** is a top priority to improve security.
- **Timeline and comment rendering**: Posts and comments are currently rendered all at once. Comments should ideally load on demand, and the timeline should support pagination for better performance. Ideally, it should also be refactored into separate `<Posts>` and `<Comments>` components to improve both performance and code readability.
- **Better test coverage**: While the app includes unit and end-to-end tests, not all user flows and endpoints are fully covered. I focused on learning TDD by prioritizing critical paths. Expanding test coverage is a key area for future improvement.

These limitations were conscious trade-offs made to prioritize functionality and learning goals during development. I plan to revisit and improve them over time.
